				<h2>Myths about our Universe</h2>
			</header>
			<h1>Myth: The Sun is Yellow</h1>
			<p>Certainly the evening sun looks yellow, doesn’t it? But the light it emits is technically white. Earth’s
				atmosphere makes our star look yellow. The gases bend the light in an effect called Rayleigh’s
				scattering, which is exactly the same phenomenon that makes the sky look blue and sunsets glow in bright
				oranges, reds and violets. The fact that astronomers classify the Sun as a yellow main sequence G star,
				or "yellow dwarf", has nothing to do with color.</p>
			<h1>Myth: Astrology Can Predict Your Personality or the Future</h1>
			<p>Wouldn’t it be fantastic to be able to take a look at tomorrow based on something as simple as where the
				Sun, the planets and the Moon were when you were born? It is what astrology claims to do and what half
				the world believes-at least in part-(and at the same time it is an incredible business). However,
				thorough scientific research into astrology has failed, time and again, always. It is impossible to
				support any prediction of an astrological sign or horoscope. A 1985 study published in the journal
				Nature was particularly noteworthy. In that experiment, scientists used an unbiased, double-blind
				protocol and worked with some of the best astrologers in the United States to assess the predictive
				power of astrological signs. The results? Astrological predictions were no better than chance. So, no,
				astrology does not predict your future or your personality.</p>
			<h1>Myth: Jupiter orbits around the Sun like other planets</h1>
			<p>Jupiter is so big, it doesn’t actually orbit around the Sun. It has a mass that is 318 times that of the
				Earth, or 2.5 times the mass that all the other planets add up together. Its enormous size causes the
				center of gravity between the Sun and itself to lie not on the Sun, but beyond the surface of our star
				(just above the surface of the Sun). This circumstance causes Jupiter not to orb around the Sun (not
				exactly, as we see), but the Sun and Jupiter both orbit their common center of mass or barycenter, the
				center of gravity of these bodies. So both the Sun and Jupiter orbit around that point in space.</p>
			<h1>Myth: Nothing Can Travel Faster Than Light</h1>
			<p>Without obstacles, light can move at 299,792,458 meters per second in the vacuum. But it slows down when
				traveling through different substances. For example, light moves 25% slower through water and 59% slower
				through diamond. Particles such as electrons, neutrons, or neutrinos can surpass photons of light in
				such materials, although they have to purge energy as radiation when they do.</p>
			<h1>Myth: The Earth is Flat (most popular one)</h1>
			<p>Despite today’s terraplanists, our learned ancestors in the High Middle Ages, for example, thought the
				Earth was round, not flat. Where does the incredible myth that the Earth is flat come from? This myth
				gained strength in the 1800s, just as the idea of evolution was growing and religious and scientific
				interests clashed. The idea spread during the first half of the 20th century and the fact that even with
				endless scientific evidence there are people defending this tremendous stolid, serves to show how
				civilisation has been and is so guilty of abusing its intellectual authority and taking advantage of
				laziness and ignorance of others. With simple arguments based on common sense we can dismantle any
				terraplane theories.</p>
